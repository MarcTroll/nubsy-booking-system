# nubsy - Nuxt 3 Booking System
A basic booking system for sport facilities developed using Nuxt 3. 

nubsy stands for Nuxt Booking System. It is completely written in [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org),
which enables SSR (server-side rendering) for Vue.js 3 while being fast and lightweight.

Because of Nuxt 3 being in beta as well as the booking system itself, you may
experience some issues setting the software up and keep it running.
**I don't recommend using this software in production until there is a
stable release.**

This project uses the Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter template. For more information
I recommend taking a look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).
