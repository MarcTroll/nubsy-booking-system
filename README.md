# Nuxt 3 Booking System
A basic booking system for sport facilities developed using Nuxt 3. 

Because of the reason that Nuxt 3 as well as the booking system itself are
currently in beta and there's no stable release until now, you may
experience some issues setting the software up and keep it running.
**I don't recommend using this software in production until there is a
stable release.**

This project uses the Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter template. For more information
I recommend taking a look at the [documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org).
